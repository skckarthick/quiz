    "options": ["25%", "20%", "18%", "16.66%"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Let original price be P and consumption be C. Expenditure = P*C. New price = 1.25P. New expenditure = (1.25P) * New_C. To keep expenditure same, P*C = 1.25P * New_C => New_C = C/1.25 = 0.8C. Reduction is 0.2C, which is (0.2C/C)*100 = 20%."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "When A runs 100m, B runs 90m and C runs 87m. This means when B runs 90m, C runs 87m. The ratio of their speeds is 90:87. In a 180m race for B, C would run (87/90)*180 = 174m. So, B beats C by 180-174 = 6m."

    "explanation": "Using the rule x^a * x^b = x^(a+b), we get (256)^(0.16+0.09) = (256)^0.25. Since 0.25 = 1/4, this is the 4th root of 256. As 4^4 = 256, the answer is 4."

    "options": ["9944", "9900", "9988", "8888"],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Largest 4-digit number is 9999. Divide 9999 by 88. 9999 = 113 * 88 + 55. The remainder is 55. So, the required number is 9999 - 55 = 9944."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Let the numbers be 3x and 4x. Their H.C.F. is x, so x=4. The numbers are 12 and 16. L.C.M. of 12 and 16 is 48."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Surface area of a cube is 6a^2, where 'a' is the side. 6a^2 = 150 => a^2 = 25 => a = 5 cm. Volume of the cube is a^3 = 5^3 = 125 cubic cm."

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "When A runs 100m, B runs 90m and C runs 87m. This means when B runs 90m, C runs 87m. The ratio of their speeds is 90:87. In a 180m race for B, C would run (87/90)*180 = 174m. So, B beats C by 180-174 = 6m."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Let son's age = x, father's age = 2x. 20 years ago, (2x-20) = 12(x-20) => 2x-20 = 12x-240 => 10x = 220 => x=22. Father's present age = 2x = 44 years."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Let the number be N. 0.35 * N = 175 => N = 175 / 0.35 = 500. Now, we need to find what percent of 175 is 500. (500/175) * 100 = (20/7) * 100 = 285.7%."

    "explanation": "Using the rule x^a * x^b = x^(a+b), we get (256)^(0.16+0.09) = (256)^0.25. Since 0.25 = 1/4, this is the 4th root of 256. As 4^4 = 256, the answer is 4."

    "explanation": "If x + 1/x = 2, the only real value for x is 1. Therefore, 1^3 + 1/1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, (x+1/x)^3 = x^3+1/x^3 + 3(x)(1/x)(x+1/x). So, 2^3 = (x^3+1/x^3) + 3(2) => 8 = (x^3+1/x^3) + 6 => x^3+1/x^3 = 2."

    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Ratio of profits = Ratio of (Capital * Time). A's investment is for 12 months, B's is for 7 months. (3500 * 12) / (B * 7) = 2/3. => 42000 / (7B) = 2/3 => 6000/B = 2/3 => 2B = 18000 => B = Rs. 9000."
